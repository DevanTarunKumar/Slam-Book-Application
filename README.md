# Slam-Book-Application

In this project, React.js was my choice for front-end. I wrote components, json files, JavaScript files, CSS, bootstrap in React.js. For back-end, I used Spring-boot. I wrote Services, RestControllers, Models and Repositories in Spring-Boot. I secured my application by using Json Web Token (JWT) which acts as a security point from where any request from front-end or client will be passed and only requests which has correct Authenticated Bearer Token will be allowed through it. For database, I used MySQL and Xampp as my localhost server. 

Front-end: React.js, CSS.

Back-end: Java, JPA, Spring boot. 

Security: Json Web Token (JWT).

Database: MySQL.
